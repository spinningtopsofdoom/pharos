## Rationale ##
Official Clojure (JVM) documentation is lacking and ClojureScript documentation is non existent.  The best existing tool [ClojureDocs](http://clojuredocs.org/) is out of date and uses the official documentation.

## Goals ##
* Document the core Clojure and ClojureScript, eventually all of the core Clojure libraries.
* Have all the documentation and history be publicly available

## Non Goals ##
* Document other Clojure projects
* Replace official documentation
* Be a tutorial or introduction to Clojure

## What documentation should have ##
* Have alternate name for symbols (i.e. -> might be named thread-last)
* Summary explaining function, macro, protocol, etc.
* Examples backing up any explanations in idiomatic Clojure / ClojureScript
* Give detailed explanation showing all use cases
* Show any existing official documentation
* Give explanation of failure modes
* Explain any surprising use cases
* Link to any known bugs / issues
* Have tags for each function, macro, protocol, etc.
* Show related functionality for each function, macro, protocol, etc.
